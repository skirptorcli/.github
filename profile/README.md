## Introduction

Skirptor is an innovative, open-source project automation tool designed to streamline development workflows and boost productivity. At its core, Skirptor allows developers to create, share, and execute project templates and automation scripts with ease, leveraging the power of cloud-based configurations and AI-assisted file updates.

## Why Skirptor?

In today's fast-paced development environment, setting up new projects, maintaining consistent structures, and performing repetitive tasks can be time-consuming and error-prone. Skirptor addresses these challenges by providing:

- **Consistency**: Ensure all team members start with the same project structure and conventions.
- **Time-saving**: Automate repetitive setup tasks and focus on actual development.
- **Flexibility**: Easily create and modify project templates to suit your specific needs.
- **Collaboration**: Share best practices and workflows across your team or the wider developer community.
- **Intelligence**: Leverage AI-powered file updates for smarter, context-aware modifications.

## Key Features

1. **Cloud-based Configurations**: Store your project templates and automation scripts in the cloud, accessible via unique codes.
2. **Powerful CLI**: Execute complex setup processes with a single command.
3. **Customizable Operations**: Define a wide range of operations, from creating files and directories to running shell commands.
4. **Interactive Setups**: Prompt users for input during the setup process for dynamic, personalized project creation.
5. **AI-Assisted File Updates**: Utilize Groq's language models to make intelligent updates to your files.
6. **Extensibility**: Easily add new operations to suit your specific workflow needs.
7. **Version Control Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with Git and other version control systems.

## How Skirptor Works

1. **Template Creation**: Developers create YAML configuration files defining project structures and setup steps.
2. **Cloud Storage**: Configurations are stored on Skirptor's cloud server and assigned unique codes.
3. **Execution**: Users run the Skirptor CLI with a configuration code, which fetches and executes the corresponding template.
4. **Dynamic Processing**: Skirptor processes the configuration, executing each step and handling user inputs.
5. **AI-Powered Updates**: For complex file modifications, Skirptor can use Groq's AI to interpret natural language instructions and make intelligent updates.

## Getting Started

1. Install the Skirptor CLI:
   ```
   npm install -g skirptor-cli
   ```

2. Set up your environment:
   ```
   export SKIRPTOR_SERVER_URL=https://api.skirptor.com
   export GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
   ```

3. Run a Skirptor configuration:
   ```
   skirptor ABC123
   ```
   Where `ABC123` is the unique code for a configuration.

## Use Cases

1. **New Project Setup**: Quickly bootstrap new projects with your preferred structure and dependencies.
2. **Onboarding**: Help new team members set up their development environment consistently.
3. **Microservice Creation**: Automate the process of creating new microservices with predefined patterns.
4. **Code Generation**: Generate boilerplate code for common patterns in your projects.
5. **Database Migrations**: Create and apply database migration scripts across your team.
6. **Deployment Preparations**: Automate pre-deployment tasks like version bumping and changelog generation.

## Extending Skirptor

Skirptor is designed to be easily extensible. You can create custom operations to suit your specific needs:

1. Create a new JavaScript file in the `operations/` directory of the CLI project.
2. Export an async function that takes `step` and `context` parameters.
3. Implement your operation logic.

Example:
```javascript
// operations/custom_lint.js
module.exports = async function custom_lint(step, context) {
  // Your custom linting logic here
};
```
